.. _usb_running:


Running scans
-------------


The hard work of the experimental setup is now done.  It involved creating all the
rich metadata container and ScanPlan objects, but with this in the past it makes
it easy and low overhead to run the scans, allowing the experimenter to concentrate
on the science and not the experimental process.


To run scans there are just a few xpdAcq
run engines(functions) that you need.  To run a scan you simply pick the run engine you want
and give it a predefined Sample object and
a predefined ScanPlan object, then hit return and sit back, your scan will be carried out.


The allowed scan types are:


.. code-block:: python

  xrun(sample, scanplan)

``xrun`` stands for "XPD run" which is a our main run engine. Full API documentation can be found :ref:`xrun_api`


Here are some examples of a workflow.  Assume a Ni_calibrant sample is loaded on the diffractometer
and the ``Ni`` Sample object is created as well as all the ``ScanPlan`` we need.
We will start by doing a scan with ``Sample`` object ``Setup`` on our ``ct_1`` ScanPlan.


Remember, always start with ``bt.list()``


.. code-block:: python


  >>> bt.list()


  ScanPlans:
  0: 'ct_5'
  1: 'ct_0.1'
  2: 'ct_1'
  3: 'ct_10'
  4: 'ct_30'
  5: 'ct_60'
  7: 'ct_1.5'
  8: 'ct_100.5'


  Samples:
  0: Setup
  1: Ni
  2: kapton_0.9mmOD
  3: kapton_1mmOD
  4: kapton_0.5mmOD
  5: activated_carbon_1
  6: activated_carbon_2
  7: activated_carbon_3
  ...


The Sample object I want has list index 0 and the ScanPlan has list index 2.
Let's try to make sure everything is ok.


.. code-block:: python


  >>> xrun(0, 2)
  INFO: requested exposure time = 1 - > computed exposure time= 1.0
  INFO: No calibration file found in config_base. Scan will still keep going on
  +-----------+------------+------------+
  |   seq_num |       time |  pe1_image |
  +-----------+------------+------------+
  |         1 | 15:58:47.4 |       5.00 |
  +-----------+------------+------------+
  generator count ['73dc71'] (scan num: 3)


OK, it seems to work, let's do some testing to see how much intensity we need.
We will do three setup scans with 1.5 seconds and 100.5 seconds exposure
and then compare them.


.. code-block:: python


  >>> xrun(0, 7)  #1.5 seconds
  INFO: requested exposure time = 1.5 - > computed exposure time= 1.5
  INFO: No calibration file found in config_base. Scan will still keep going on
  +-----------+------------+------------+
  |   seq_num |       time |  pe1_image |
  +-----------+------------+------------+
  |         1 | 16:01:37.3 |       5.00 |
  +-----------+------------+------------+
  generator count ['728f2f'] (scan num: 5)


  >>> setupscan(0, 8)  #100.5 seconds
  INFO: requested exposure time = 100.5 - > computed exposure time= 100.5
  INFO: No calibration file found in config_base. Scan will still keep going on
  +-----------+------------+------------+
  |   seq_num |       time |  pe1_image |
  +-----------+------------+------------+
  |         1 | 16:02:57.0 |       5.00 |
  +-----------+------------+------------+
  generator count ['981e70'] (scan num: 6)




It seems that the 2 second scans are the best, so let's do[b] with desired ``Sample``
to get the first data-set.


.. code-block:: python


  >>>In [13]: xrun(0, 8)
  INFO: requested exposure time = 100.5 - > computed exposure time= 100.5
  INFO: closing shutter...
  INFO: taking dark frame....
  INFO: No calibration file found in config_base. Scan will still keep going on
  +-----------+------------+------------+
  |   seq_num |       time |  pe1_image |
  +-----------+------------+------------+
  |         1 | 16:04:31.4 |       5.00 |
  +-----------+------------+------------+
  generator count ['d770c7'] (scan num: 7)
  opening shutter...
  INFO: No calibration file found in config_base. Scan will still keep going on
  +-----------+------------+------------+
  |   seq_num |       time |  pe1_image |

  +-----------+------------+------------+
  generator count ['0beaaf'] (scan num: 8)



.. _auto_dark:


Automated dark collection
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

You might have found something weird when you ran the ``xrun`` command:


*I only requested one ``xrun`` but the program runs two scans*


So what happened?


That is a feature called auto-dark subtraction in ``xpdAcq``.
When you are running your experiment, ``xpdAcq`` checks if you have
collected a **fresh and appropriate** dark frame every time it collects a scan.
The definition of **fresh and appropriate** is:


**Nice and fresh**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


  .. code-block:: none


    Given a certain period T (``dark window``), there exists a dark frame
    with the same **total exposure time** and exactly the same **acquisition time**
    as the light frame we are about collect.


  .. note::


    At **XPD**, the area detector is running in ``continuous acquisition`` mode,
    which means detector keeps **reading** but only **saves** images when ``xpdAcq``
    tells it to save, with the desired exposure time.

    In short,

    * acquisition time is the collection time for a single frame from area detector.
      This can take values between 0.1s to 5s.

    * exposure time is the user-defined total acquisition time

  Automated dark collection is enabled by default and it can be turned off by:

  .. code-block:: python

    glbl['auto_dark'] = False
    glbl['shutter_control'] = False


  And the duration of your dark window can be modified by:


  .. code-block:: python

    glbl['dk_window'] = 200 # in minutes. default is 3000 minutes


  Having ``auto_dark`` set to ``True`` is strongly recommended as this enables
  ``xpdAcq`` to do automated dark frame subtraction when you pull out data from the
  centralized **NSLS-II** server.


.. _auto_calib:


Automated calibration capture
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""


Often times, keeping track of which calibration file is associated with a specific scan is very tiring. ``xpdAcq`` makes this easier or you. Before every
scan is being collected, the program goes to grab the most recent calibration
parameters in ``xpdUser/config_base`` and load them as part of the
metadata so that you can reference them whenever you want, and make in-situ data
reduction possible!


.. _calib_manual:


Quick guide of calibration steps with pyFAI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. We assume that you have run ``run_calibration()`` in the ``collection`` window
with Ni as your calibrant.  This will automatically expose the Ni, and after a
pause a 2D plot window should pop up on the acquisition computer, looking
something like this:

  .. image:: ./img/calib_05.png
    :width: 400px
    :align: center
    :height: 300px


  That is the image we want to perform our  calibration with. Use the **magnify
  tool** at the tool bar to zoom in to something that looks like the figure below.
  The magnifying tool is enabled by clicking on the button on the toolbar that
  looks like a magnifying glass.

  Now we will select five rings that PyFAI will use to do the calibration.  To do this
  click on the magnifying glass button again to deselect the magnifying tool so the cursor
  looks like an arrow.  You will place the tip
  of the arrow on the first ring and then **RIGHT click**.  you will see dots going around the
  ring you have selected.  Then repeat this for the other four rings you will select.
  `For the highest accuracy, We recommend that you select the first, second, third and
  6th ring, as shown in the figure.`  The 6th ring is weaker but well separated from its neighbor.

  .. image:: ./img/calib_07.png
    :width: 400px
    :align: center
    :height: 300px

2. If you don't like what you have selected, you can exit out using ``CTL-C`` and start again
   by running `run_calibration()`.  However, if you are happy with your selections accept them by first
   making the collection terminal window active by clicking on it, then hitting ``<enter>``.

   You will now follow the instructions coming from PyFAI.  It asks you to supply the
   indices of the rings you have selected.  Because PyFAI was written by a computer
   scientist and not a scientist, **the first ring has number 0**, the second has
   number 1, the third has number 2 and the 6th has number 5.

   If everything has gone well, after supplying all the indices, PyFAI will pop
   up a number of plots that can give an expert eye some indication of the quality
   of the calibration.  We recommend that you type ``recalib`` and
   then ``<enter>`` when prompted to
   "modify parameters". This will cause pyFAI to refine the ring selection.
   If the dashed lines look as if they are lining up well with
   the peaks you have a good calibration.  If not, `CTL-C` and start again.  If yes,
   activate the terminal window by clicking on it, hit ``<enter>`` at the command prompt
   then type ``done``.


  .. image:: ./img/calib_08.png
    :width: 400px
    :align: center
    :height: 300px

  PyFAI can be a bit finicky.  If it hangs, type CTL-C and start over and make
  sure you follow the instruction exactly.

  .. Note::

    You may find more information about calibration process from `pyFAI documentation <http://pyfai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/cookbook/calibrate.html#start-pyfai-calib>`_

3. You are done! ``xpdAcq`` has saved the calibration parameters and will store them will all subsequent scans until you
   run another calibration.

   To see the current calibration parameters, type ``show_calib()``.

   You can also find the calibration parameters in a file called
   ``pyFAI_calib.yml`` in ``.../xpdUser/config_base``

3. To clean up you can close all the PyFAI windows, including
   the 1D integration and 2D regrouping results that pop out (see below).
   Return to the ``Quick start tutorial`` by hitting the browser back-arrow.

.. _import_sample:


Sample metadata imported from spreadsheet
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""


In order to facilitate retrospective operation on data, we suggest you to enter
as much information as you can and that is the main philosophy behind ``xpdAcq``.


Typing in sample metadata during beamtime is always less efficient and it wastes
your time so a pre-populated excel sheet with all metadata entered beforehand
turns out to be the solution.


In order import sample metadata from spreadsheet, we would need you to have a
pre-filled spreadsheet with name ``<saf_number>_sample.xls`` sit in ``xpduser/import``
directory. Then the import process is simply:


.. code-block:: python


  import_sample_info()

``xpdAcq`` will grab the ``saf_number`` and ``bt`` for current beamtime, so make sure you have your spreadsheet named with proper format. For example, if your SAF number is ``300179``, then you should have your pre-populated spreadsheet with the name as ``300179_sample.xls``, sit inside ``xpdUser/import`` directory.


To parse the information filled inside your spreadsheet, we have designed
several rules and here are the explanation to each of the rules.

comma separated fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


  Files with information entities are separated by a comma ``,``.


  Each separated by ``,`` will be individually searchable later.


  Fields following this parsing rule are:


  ======================  ========================================================
  ``cif name``            pointer of potential structures for your sample, if any.
  ``User supplied tags``  any comment you want to put on for this measurement.
  ======================  ========================================================


  Example on ``User supplied tags``:


  .. code-block:: none


    background, standard --> background, standard


  And a search on either ``background`` or``standard`` later on will include
  this header.




name fields
^^^^^^^^^^^


  Fields that are used to store a person's name in ``first name last name`` format.


  Each person's first and last name will be searchable later on.


  Fields following this parsing rule are:


  ======================    =========================================================
  ``Collaborators``         name of your collaborators
  ``Sample Maker``          name of your sample maker
  ``Lead Experimenters``    a person who is going to lead this experiment at beamline
  ======================    =========================================================


  Example on name fields:


  .. code-block:: none


    Maxwell Terban, Benjamin Frandsen ----> Maxwell, Terban, Benjamin, Frandsen


  A search on either ``Maxwell`` or ``Terban`` or ``Benjamin`` or ``Frandsen``
  later will include this header.




phase string
^^^^^^^^^^^^


  Field used to specify the phase information and chemical composition of your
  sample. It's important to enter this field correctly so that we can have
  accelerated data reduction workflow.


  Fields follows this parsing rule are:


  ==============  ==============================================================
  ``Phase Info``  field to specify phase information and chemical composition of
                  your sample
  ==============  ==============================================================


  phase string will be expect to be enter in a form as
  ``phase_1: amount, phase_2: amount``.


  An example of 0.9% sodium chloride solution will be:


  .. code-block:: none


    Nacl: 0.09, H20: 0.91


  This ``Phase Info`` will be parsed as:


  .. code-block:: python


    {'sample_composition': {'Na':0.09, 'Cl':0.09, `H`:1.82, `O`:0.91},
     'sample_phase': {'NaCl':0.09, 'H20':0.91},
     'composition_string': 'Na0.09Cl0.09H1.82O0.91'}


  ``composition_string`` is designed for data reduction software going to be
  used. Under ``xpdAcq`` framework, we will assume
  `pdfgetx3 <http://www.diffpy.org/products/pdfgetx3.html>`_


  As before, a search on ``Na`` or ``Cl`` or ``H`` or ``O`` will include this
  header. Also a search on ``Nacl=0.09`` will include this header as well.


dictionary-like fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Fields that are utilized to store information as ``key-value pair`` format.
  Standard format of it is ``key: value`` and it also follows the comma-separate rule

  Fields following this parsing rule are:

  =====================================  ===================================
  ``structural database ID for phases``  database name and the ID for
                                         sample phases
  =====================================  ===================================

  Example on dictionary-like fields:


  .. code-block:: none


    ICSD:41120, CCDC:850926 ----> {'ICSD': '41120', 'CCDC': '850926'}


Sample Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* **Sample**:


  Each row in your spreadsheet will be taken as one valid Sample and metadata
  will be parsed based on the contents you type in with above parsing rule.


  Generally, after successfully importing sample from spreadsheet, that is what
  you would see:


.. code-block:: python


  In [1]: import_sample_info()
  *** End of import Sample object ***

  In [2]: bt.list()


  ScanPlans:




  Samples:
  0: P2S
  1: Ni_calibrant
  2: activated_carbon_1
  3: activated_carbon_2
  4: activated_carbon_3
  5: activated_carbon_4
  6: activated_carbon_5
  7: activated_carbon_6
  8: FeF3(4,4-bipyridyl)
  9: Zn_MOF
  ...


  41: ITO_glass_noFilm
  42: ITO_glass_1hrHeatUpTo250C_1hrhold250C_airdry
  43: ITO_glass_1hrHeatUpTo450C_1hrhold450C_airdry
  44: ITO_glass_30minHeatUpTo150C_1.5hrhold150C_airdry
  45: CeO2_film_calibrant
  46: bkg_1mm_OD_capillary
  47: bkg_0.9mm_OD_capillary
  48: bkg_0.5mm_OD_capillary
  49: bkg_film_on_substrate

.. _background_obj:

* **Background**:

  It is recommended to run a background scan before your sample so it is available for
  the automated data reduction steps.  It also allows you to see problems with the
  experimental setup, for example, crystalline peaks due to the beam hitting a shutter.

  You can associate a Sample as the background for the desired
  Sample freely. Linking the background with the sample together also makes the
  data-reduction workflow easier.

  We specify this grouping by entering background sample name into the
  ``Sample-name of sample background``  column in the spreadsheet. You can
  fill in the *Sample Name of your background* to whichever sample you want to relate.

  For example, in our `spreadsheet template <https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/xpd-users/_6NSRWg_-l0>`_ we created pure background
  objects kapton_1mmOD, kapton_0.9mmOD and kapton_0.5mmOD
  and we link Ni with background kapton_1mmOD by specifying it
  at ``Sample-name of sample background`` column.

  A proper linking between **Sample** and **Background** can be seen
  from metadata stored inside the ``Sample`` object. As usual, let's
  interrogate the metadata:

  .. code-block:: python

    In[]: bt.samples.get_md(15)  # that's for example, index depends on
                                 # your spreadsheet
    out[]:
    {'bkgd_sample_name': 'kapton_0.9mmOD',
     'bt_piLast': 'Billinge',
     ...
    }

  The example above shows your ``Sample`` with index ``15`` has been
  linked with background ``kapton_0.9mmOD``. This can largely speeds up
  the automated data-reduction workflow that we will have in the future!

.. _auto_mask:

Auto-masking
""""""""""""

Masking can be a tedious process, requiring long hours judging which pixels
are good and which need to be removed. The our automated masking software aims
to alleviate this by applying a set of masks in sequence to return better
quality data.


Masks can be created/used in two ways. The default procedure is a mask is
created for a low scattering sample (usually kapton). Then this mask is reused
for each subsequent image taken with the same detector position. The second
modality is that each image gets is own bespoke mask, potentially derived from
the low scattering mask.




Applied masks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0. Any mask passed in to the software:
    If you have any preexisting masks, we will use those as a starting position
    to add upon.


1. Edge mask:
    A default of 30 pixels from the edge of the detector are masked out.
    These pixels are usually faulty as the detector edge has lower than
    expected intensity.


2. Lower threshold mask:
    A lower threshold mask, which removes all pixels who's intensities are
    lower than a certain value is applied. The default threshold is 0.0


3. Upper threshold mask:
    An upper threshold mask, which removes all pixels who's intensities are
    higher than a certain value is applied. This mask is not applied in the
    default settings.


4. Beamstop holder mask:
    A beamstop holder mask, which removes pixels underneath a straight
    beamstop holder is applied. The beamstop holder is masked by finding the
    beamcenter and drawing a pencil like shape from the beamcenter to the edge
    of the detector. All the pixels within this polygon are masked. The default
    settings are to mask out 30 pixels on either side of the line connecting
    the beamcenter and the detector edge


5. Binned outlier mask:
    Lastly a binned outlier mask is applied, removing pixels which are alpha
    standard deviations away from the mean intensity as a function of Q. This
    mask aims to remove many of the dead/hot pixels and streaks. The default
    alpha is 3 standard deviations.



.. _client_server_md:

client/server metadata schema
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Overview with an example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``client/server`` schema associate different data with a centralized
mapping, which would allow a more flexible way to link data. Let's take
calibration as an example. Ideally one will perform a calibration run
before collecting any data so that subsequent runs will be referenced to
the experimental geometry deduced from this calibration run. However,
there might be some time calibration run is executed after data is
collected due to practical situation. Under traditional metadata schema,
the data collected prior to the calibration will not be able to associated
with given geometry in a systematic way; it relies on experimenter to
identify which data should be grouped and this add complexities of
analyzing data after the beamtime.

The ``client/server`` schema is designed to solve the problem described above.
At the beginning of the beamtime, an unique ``exp_hash_uid`` is generated.
Every subsequent run will inserted with the metadata ``client_uid=exp_hash_uid``
while the calibration run will have ``server_uid=exp_hash_uid`` in the metadata.
Therefore, by querying scans with the matched client/server uid, production runs
and calibration runs are linked by regardless the order in time. Furthermore,
this ``client/server`` schema would allow the recalibration if any factor related
to defining experimental geometry, such as wavelength, was known to be in accurate.

The ``client/server`` logic can be extended to other kinds of mapping as well.
Currently, ``xpdAcq`` utilizes this logic in associating calibration runs with
production runs.

when and how to change ``exp_hash_uid``?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's strongly suggested to update the ``exp_hash_uid`` whenever there is
a sensible change to your experimental setup, for example, different detectors,
changes in sample stages, fluctuation of ring current and so on. In this way,
the data that is referenced to the same experiment condition will be more
tightly associated and will make future data analysis easier as direct comparison
is possible.

To update the ``exp_hash_uid``, please type following command in the ``collection``
terminal of your ipython.

.. code:: python

  update_exp_hash_uid()

  # example output
  #INFO: experiment hash uid has been updated to 3020835e-9cb3-4c63-9bf4-4834bf5e865f

Once ``exp_hash_uid`` is updated, all subsequent runs will have the
updated ``client_uid`` metadata and calibration runs will has this new uid
as ``server_uid``.

.. note::

  The idea of ``hash`` is borrowed from computer science. It means we conceptually
  represent all experiment related factors, ranging from the instruments inside
  and outside the hutch, synchrotron beam current to ambient temperature, as a
  unique identifier, ``uid``. Therefore, this identifier could be use for mapping
  data that shares common experiment related factors.


.. _folder_tag:


User defined folder tag
"""""""""""""""""""""""

You can also add metadata to the run by adding key word arguments to the run eg
``xrun(0, 8, my_scan_tag='hello world')``. Some pieces of metadata are special,
like ``folder_tag_list``. When ``folder_tag_list`` is added
(eg ``xrun(0, 8, folder_tag_list=['status', 'sample_name', bt_piLast'], status='after_saxs')``
the values for those keys will be added to the file path in the same order as
the list
(eg ``<.../tiff_base/after_saxs/Ni/billinge/mask/file_name>`` for an experiment
on Nickel run by the Billinge group).



Let's :ref:`take a quick look at our data <usb_quickassess>`
