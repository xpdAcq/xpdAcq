``xpdAcq`` features
====================

.. _auto_dark:

Automated dark collection
--------------------------

you might have found something weird when you running a ``xrun`` command:

*I only requested one ``xrun`` but program runs two scans*

So what happen?

That is actually a feature called auto-dark subtraction of ``xpdAcq``.
When you are running your experiment, ``xpdAcq`` actually checks if you have
collected a **fresh and appropriate** dark frame every time it collects a scan.
The definition of **fresh and appropriate** is:

**Nice and fresh**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: none

  Given a certain period T (``dark window``), there exists a dark frame
  with the same **total exposure time** and exactly the same **acquisition time**
  as the light frame we are about collect.

.. note::

  At **XPD**, area detector is running in ``continuous acquisition`` mode,
  which means detector keeps **reading** but only **saves** image when ``xpdAcq``
  tells it to with desired exposure time. In short,

  * acquisition time defines how fast is detector reading time,
    ranged from 0.1s to 5s.

  * exposure time means total exposure time, which user defined.

Automated dark collection is enabled by default and it can be turned off by:

.. code-block:: python

  glbl.auto_dark = False
  glbl.shutter_control = False

And period of dark window can be modified by:

.. code-block:: python

  glbl.dk_window = 200 # in minutes. default is 3000 minutes

Having ``auto_dark`` set to ``True`` is strongly recommended as this enables
``xpdAcq`` to do automated dark frame subtraction when you pull out data from
centralized **NSLS-II** server.

.. _auto_calib:

Automated calibration capture
-----------------------------

Often times, keeping track with which calibration file is associated with
certain scan is very tiring. ``xpdAcq`` makes this easier for you. Before every
scan is being collected, program goes to grab the most recent calibration
parameters in ``/home/xf28id1/xpdUser/config_base`` and load them as part of
metadata so that you can reference them whenever you want and make in-situ data
reduction possible!

.. _calib_manual:

Quick guide of calibration steps with pyFAI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. First you will see an image window like this:

  .. image:: ./img/calib_05.png
    :width: 400px
    :align: center
    :height: 300px

  That is the image we want to perform azimuthal calibration with. Use magnify
  tool at the tool bar to zoom in and **right click** rings. Starting from
  the first, inner ring and to outer rings. Usually a few rings (~5) should be
  enough.

  .. image:: ./img/calib_07.png
    :width: 400px
    :align: center
    :height: 300px

2. After selecting rings, click on the *original* terminal and hit ``<enter>``.
Then you will be requested to supply indices of rings you just selected.
Remember index **starts from 0** as we are using ``python``.
After supplying all indices, you should have a window to show your calibration:

  .. image:: ./img/calib_08.png
    :width: 400px
    :align: center
    :height: 300px

  Program will ask you if you want to modify parameters, in most of case, you
  don't have to. So just hit ``<enter>`` in the terminal and integration will be
  done.

3. Finally 1D integration and 2D regrouping results will pop out:

  .. image:: ./img/calib_09.png
    :width: 400px
    :align: center
    :height: 300px

  You can qualitatively interrogate your calibration by looking if lines in
  2D regrouping are straight or not.

  After this step, a calibration file with name ``pyFAI_calib.yml`` will be
  saved under ``/home/xf28id1/xpdUser/config_base``

Alright, you are done then! With ```automated calibration capture`` feature, ``xpdAcq``
will load calibration parameters from the most recent config file.

.. _import_sample:

metadata imported from spreadsheet
-----------------------------------

In order to facilitate , we suggest you to enter
as much information as you can and that is the main philosophy behind ``xpdAcq``.

Typing in sample metadata during beamtime is always less efficient and it wastes
your time so a pre-populated excel sheet with all metadata entered beforehand
turns out to be the solution.


parsing rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **comma separated fields**: information entities are separated by a comma.

    * ``cif name``: pointer of potential structures for your sample, if any.

    * ``Tags``: any comment you want to put on for this measurement.

* **name fields**:

* **phase string**:

.. _auto_mask:

Auto-masking
-------------

* auto-masking with user defined beamstop mask
