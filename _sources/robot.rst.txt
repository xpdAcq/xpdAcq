Using the Robot
===============

XPD is equipped with a sample loading robot, which requires special syntax to use properly.

0. Load data into ``bt`` as usual
----------------------------------

Follow the normal routine for loading data from the sample spreadsheet from import_sample_.

1. Tell ``bt`` about where the samples are loaded in the robot magazine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To use the robot properly ``bt`` needs to know where the samples are loaded.
This is achieved by running ``bt.robot_location_number()``.
This will prompt you to enter the location for each sample currently in
``bt``.
If the sample is not in the magazine that's ok just leave the prompt
 blank and hit ``<enter>``.


2. Run ``xrun`` with the robot flag
-----------------------------------

To run the scans run
``run(<list of sample numbers>, <scan number>, robot=True)``.
``xrun`` will report the contents of the scan so you can review it before
executing.

For example

    .. code-block:: python

       xrun([3, 4, 5], 2, robot=True)


Advanced usage
--------------

The robot and ``xrun`` are more flexible than just running one scan.
Multiple scans can be run per sample.

For example here is a run that runs different plans per sample

    .. code-block:: python

       xrun([3, 4, 5, 5], [2, 2, 2, 5], robot=True)

Note that sample ``5`` has two scans, ``2`` and ``5``.

The only constraint is that if the scans are in a list, that the number of
samples needs to equal the number of scans.
Don't worry about listing a sample multiple times in a row,
we won't unload and reload the same sample.
If samples not in a row, eg. ``[3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5]`` we *will* uload and reload
the samples.
