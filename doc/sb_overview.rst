Overview of xpd acquisition environment
---------------------------------------

All experiments will be carried out in the ``~/xpdUsers`` directory tree.

At the beginning of the beamtime users are presented with a standard set of directories
inside  ``~/xpdUsers``.  The directories and their purpose are shown in the table
below.

All the directories will be empty initially, except that users can place in the
import directory file with the name <PIname>_<saf#>_config.yml that contains
pre-defined quantities.  Normally this file will be generated by running a simulation
of the experiment using the xpdSim package (to be released).  If no such file 
exists that is not a problem, but there will be much more typing to set up the
metadata for the beamtime.

Once the directories are set-up, the experiment is run by typing `icollection`
which places you into an ipython session.  The available commands and workflow
are described under :ref:`xpdu`.

+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|directory name |contents                                                    |
+===============+============================================================+
|Import         |User places here their pre-made beamtime metata in a file called |
|               |``<PIname>_<saf#>_config.yml``                              |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|Export         |A zipped tar file will be placed here at the end of the     |
|               |beamtime containing *everything* that the user created in   |
|               |in any directory below ``~/xpdUser``. This is for the user  |
|               |to take home on their hard-drive                            |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|config_base    |This contains the config file used by ``xPDFsuite``.        |
|               |xPDFsuite will write this file.  The user should not edit or|
|               |add anything to this directory                              |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|tif_base       |This is where all the image files (.tiff) are stored *that* |
|               |*the user extracts* from the database using dataBroker  |
|               |scripts during the experiment.                              |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|dark_base      |This is where image files from dark-exposures are stored    |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|userScripts    |This is a handy space where the users can write their own   |
|               |experiment scripts and save them. They will be bundled up   |
|               |at the end of the experiment for shipping home              |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|userAnalysis   |Users can create any sets of directories under here for     |
|               |storing analyzed files (for example, saved by xPDFsuite).   |
|               |it is expected that most of these will be 1D files such as  |
|               |raw 1D diffraction intensities, g(r) and F(Q) files.        |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|...            |Actually, the users can create any directories and files    |
|               |they want and they will be bundled, tarred and zipped at the|
|               |end for them to take home.                                  |
