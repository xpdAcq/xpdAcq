Checklist
+++++++++

The instrument scientist (IS) should have set up your beamtime hardware and software
for you.  Let's check if it is the case.

1. Activate the XPD data acquisition environment:

  * In a terminal look to see if it is already activated.  If it is, you should see ``(collection)`` at the beginning of the line.

  .. code-block:: none

    (collection)xf28id1@xf28id1-ws2:~$

  * If you don't see it, type ``icollection`` at the command prompt then check again.

2. OK, you are in.  Make sure that that the instrument scientist has initiated your beamtime. type ``bt.md`` and hit return. You should see the beamtime (``bt``) metadata (``md``) that has been pre-stored by the IS, and it should contain things like the last name of the PI on the proposal and the SAF number for the beamtime.  If not, please seek out the IS to get your session initialized.
3. Check that the wavelength has been set.  Does the correct x-ray wavelength appear in ``bt.md`` ``['bt_wavelength']`` field, or does it say ``None``.  If the latter, you can still collect scans but automated data reduction may not work, so best to grab the IS again.
4. Has a calibration already been carried out?  [FIXME]
5. Check that the Perkin Elmer detector is correctly set up.

  * Look at the Perkin Elmer screen on the CSS and make sure that ``Acquire`` mode has been enabled. If Acquire mode is enabled, it should show system information ``Collecting`` in yellow color. If it hasn't been activated, please click 'start' button.

    :width: 300px
    :align: center
    :height: 200px

  * Type ``glbl.area_det`` and return.  It should return:

   .. code-block:: python

     In [5]: glbl.area_det
     Out[5]: PerkinElmerContinuous(prefix='XF:28IDC-ES:1{Det:PE1}', name='pe1', read_attrs=['tiff', 'stats1'], configuration_attrs=['images_per_set', 'number_of_sets'], monitor_attrs=[])

There are other setups that you can do to make your experiment run smoothly,  but you seem to be set up ok, so let's go and collect some data.

Collecting Data Quickstart
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The basic way to collect data is to carry out a "scan", by typing the kind of scan and giving it as arguments a ``sample-object`` and a ``scanplan-object``.  These objects just contain information that will either be used to run the scan, and/or just saved as metadata with the data, allowing you to find the data later and process it. You will make your own objects later, but for now you can do a quick scan just to collect some data with some predefined objects.

 1. Type ``bt.list()`` and return.  You should see a list of objects and their index, or the number they sit in the list.
 2. To run a scan you type ``prun(<sample-object>,<scanplan-object>)``:

   ``prun`` supports different ways of assigning objects. You can either assign objects with object index, name of acquire object or ``bt.get()`` methods.
   Following expressions are all equivalent.

   .. code-block:: python

     prun(bt.get(2), bt.get(5))
     prun('l-user', bt.get(5))
     prun(bt.get(2), 'ct1s')
     prun(2,5)
     prun('l-user','ct1s')

   Replace those words in angle brackets with pointers to real objects, eg.:

   1. ``prun(bt.get(2),bt.get(5))`` will do a scan on the dummy sample (``'sa'``) called ``'l-user'``--(for lazy user!) which is in position (index) ``2`` in the ``bt.list()`` list--for 1 second (the name of that object in the list at position ``5`` is ``'ct1s'`` which stands for "count 1 second").
   2. ``prun(bt.get(2),bt.get(7))`` will do a scan for 10 s on the same sample.
   3. ``setupscan(bt.get(2),bt.get(7))`` will do a setupscan on that sample for 10 seconds.  A setupscan is like a prun ("production run") except it is tagged in metadata as a setupscan so you can separate later which were production runs and which were setup-scans.

 3. to see the data you have to extract it from the NSLS-ii database.

   1. Type ``save_last_tiff()`` to get the most recent scan you ran.  A dark-subtracted tiff file will appear in the directory ``~/xpdUser/tiff_base`` with prefix ``sub_`` in file name.
   2. ``save_tiff(db[-2])`` gets you the second to last scan that was collected, ``save_tiff(db[-10:])`` gets you the last 10 scans, (the syntax is Pythonic but it means "the items in the list from 10 ago up to the end of the list, i.e., now".  You can do all kinds of slicing and dicing, for example ``db[-10:-8,-2]`` would return the scans that were tenth, ninth and eighth ago, and also the last but one.) and so on.
   3. The tiff file appears in the directory ``~/xpdUser/tiff_base`` with a reasonably recognizable automatically generated name and you can do pretty much what you like with it. For example, copy it to an external drive.  However, there are handy tools on the XPD computer for analyzing your data.  As long as you save all your work in the ``xpdUser`` directory tree (make as many directories as you like under there) your work will be archived in a remote location at the end of your beamtime, and then completely deleted from the local XPD computer so that the next user has their own fresh environment to work in but your work is safe.
   4. To use data analysis tools on the XPD computer, **in a new terminal window**

     * Type ``getxgui``
     * proceed to :ref:`xPDFsuite_manual`

Remember!
+++++++++
   1. ``bt.list()`` to see what objects are available
   2. ``prun(bt.get(<sampleIndex>)bt.get(<scanplanIndex>))`` to run the scan
   3. ``save_tiff(db[list_of_scans])`` to get the data back as a tiff file
   4. ``getxgui`` (xPDFsuite) to visualize it, integrate it to 1D and process to get a diffraction pattern or PDF.

Next Steps
++++++++++

So you have collected some data, and looked at it.  It is probably time to set up some more extensive data-objects so that you will be able to search easily for your data later and do more sophisticated scans.
Please take the time to read the full documentation from **XPD user** section to get the most out of your data.  But for now, here is a quick summary.

Types of scan available.
  They all take as arguments ``(<sample-object>, <scanplan-object>)`` in that order:

  1. ``prun()`` - the one you will use the most.  It stands for "production run"
  2. ``setupscan()`` - it is just the same as ``prun()`` but the data are tagged as being test/setup data, helping you to keep track of what is what later.
  3. ``dryrun()`` - it doesn't execute anything, only prints out metadata
  4. ``dark()`` - collects a dark scan (shutter closed).  The default behavior is that darks are collected automatically and linked to lights so if all is going well you should never have to use this, but in case you do it is there.
  5. ``background()`` - Like ``prun()`` but it tags the dataset as a background scan for that sample and scanplan configuration
  6. ``calibration()`` - Similary to ``prun()`` and above scans, but your data will be labeled with as a calibration scan so that you can easily trace back what calibrants you have used and when were those calibration scans collected.

You should try and set up some of your own scanplan objects:
  * let's say you want to do a count scan for 1.5 minutes.

    1. type ``bt.list('sp')``  to see the current list of scanplan objects
    2. scan parameters to ``ScanPlan`` can be assigned explicitly by giving a dictionary
      or be interpreted by auto-naming scheme. Here is the example:

      .. code-block:: python

        sp1 = ScanPlan('ct_90','ct',{'exposure':90})
        sp2 = ScanPlan('ct_90')

      ``sp1`` and ``sp2`` are equivalent. They both creates a ``'ct'`` or count-type scan with an exposure of 90 s or 1.5 minutes.
      To find more on auto-naming scheme, please see :ref:`usb_Scan`

    3. type ``bt.list('sp')`` again.  You should see your new scanplan object at the end of the list.  Run it using ``prun(bt.get(2),bt.get(11))`` or giving a different number to the second ``get`` if it has a different number in the list.

Types of ScanPlan available in current version:
  * ``'ct'`` just exposes the the detector for a number of seconds. e.g.,  ``ScanPlan('ct17.5s','ct',{'exposure':17.5})``
  * ``'tseries'`` executes a series of ``'num'`` counts of exposure time ``'exposure'`` seconds with  a delay of ``'delay'`` seconds between them.  e.g., ``ScanPlan('tseries_1_59_50','tseries',{'num':50,'exposure':1,'delay':59})`` will measure 50 scans of 1 second with a delay of 59 seconds in between each of them.
  * ``'Tramp'`` executes a temperature ramp from ``'startingT'`` to ``'endingT'`` in temperature steps of ``'Tstep'`` with exposure time of ``'exposure'``.  e.g., ``ScanPlan('Tramp_1_200_500_5','Tramp',{'startingT':200, 'endingT':500, 'Tstep':5, 'exposure':1})`` will automatically change the temperature,
    starting at 200 K and ending at 500 K, measuring a scan of 1 s at every 5 K step. The temperature controller will hold at each temperature until the temperature stabilizes before starting the measurement.

Here is a summary table:

=========== ==================================================================================================
ScanPlan    Syntax
=========== ==================================================================================================
``ct``      ``ScanPlan('ct17.5','ct',{'exposure':17.5})``
``tseries`` ``ScanPlan('tseries_1_59_50','tseries',{'num':50,'exposure':1,'delay':59})``
``Tramp``   ``ScanPlan('Tramp_1_200_500_5','Tramp',{'startingT':200, 'endingT':500, 'Tstep':5, 'exposure':1})``
=========== ==================================================================================================

Tiff naming schema:
  The tiff file will be saved with the name:

  .. code-block:: none

    <sample_name>_<scanplan_name>_<time_stamp>_<uid>_<something_else>_<sequence_number>.tif

  All the information in the ``scanplan`` and ``sample`` objects will be saved to metadata and searchable and usable for processing later.
  ``<uid>`` is the unique identifier to this ``scanplan``. You can use it to search specific scan later.
  ``<something-else>`` depends on the ``scanplan`` type, for example, for a ``Tramp`` it is the actual temperature read from the temperature controller when the data-collection was initiated for that point.
  ``<sequence number>`` will be in ``0001, 0002, ...`` format, which tells you the sequence index of ``scan`` from a``scanplan``.

Experiment and sample objects:
  1. It is time well spent to set up all your experiment and sample objects accurately.
  To set up a sample you have to give it an experiment object, so ``Sample('Li battery electrode',bt.get(96))`` uses the object in ``bt.list(96)`` which must be an ``ex`` type object, for example I #may have made# it with ``Experiment('cycled and uncycled batteries',bt)``.
  The ``bt`` is the beamtime object. For complete documentation, please see :ref:`usb_experiment`

  2. It is also possible to download xpdAcq `from here <https://github.com/xpdAcq/xpdAcq>`_ and run it on your own computer to set up the ``sample`` and ``scanplan`` objects you think you will need at the beamtime.
  So when you are at XPD you can concentrate on collecting data and not typing metadata.
  Simulation at home is strongly recommended. See the full documentation for more details at here [FIXME doc needed]

User scripts:
  Your ``scanplan`` objects can be sequenced into scripts, executing one after the other as you desire.  To set this up, write a sequence of commands into a text file, save it with the extension ``.py`` in the ``userScripts`` directory with a memorable name, like ``myNightShiftScript.py``.  Double and triple check your script, then when you are ready to execute it, in ``ipython`` session type:

  .. code-block:: python

    %run -i ~/xpdUser/userScripts/myNightShiftScript.py

  Stay there for a while to make sure everything is running as expected and go to bed!

There is much more to the ``xpdAcq`` software that will give you superpowers in rapid and flexible data collection, data retrieval and processing.
This was just the quick start, but much more information is in the full documentation at **XPD user** section

Code Sample
+++++++++++

Here is a sample code covering entire process from defining ``Experiment``,
``Sample`` and ``ScanPlan`` objects to running ``ScanPlans`` with different kinds of ``run``.
Please replace the name and parameters in each function depending your need.

**Tip**: copy-and-paste is *always* your good friend

.. code-block:: python


  # bt list method to see objects we have
  bt.list()

  # define acquire objects
  ex = Experiment('xpdAcq_test', bt)
  sa = Sample('xpdAcq_test_Sample', ex)

  # define "ct" scanplan with exp = 0.5
  ct = ScanPlan('xpdAcq_test_ct','ct',{'exposure':0.5})

  # define "TrampUp" scanplan with exp = 0.5, startingT = 300, endingT = 310, Tstep = 2
  # define "TrampDown" scanplan with exp = 0.5, startingT = 310, endingT = 300, Tstep = 2
  TrampUp = ScanPlan('xpdAcq_test_Tramp','Tramp',{'exposure':0.5, 'startingT': 300, 'endingT': 310, 'Tstep':2})
  TrampDown = ScanPlan('xpdAcq_test_Tramp','Tramp',{'exposure':0.5, 'startingT': 310, 'endingT': 300, 'Tstep':2})

  # define "time series" scanplan with exp = 0.5, num=10, delay = 2
  tseries = ScanPlan('xpdAcq_test_tseries', 'tseries', {'exposure':0.5, 'num':5, 'delay':2})


  # Frist, let use dryrun with different ScanPlans to have a preview on scan metadata
  dryrun(sa, ct)

  # Then let's do calibration run and save the image in order to open it in calibration software
  calibration(sa, ct)
  save_last_tiff()

  # Use setupscan to check image quality under current scan parameters
  setupscan(sa, ct)
  save_last_tiff()

  # Everything looks right. Let's do prun with different ScanPlans and save the tiffs
  prun(sa, ct)
  save_last_tiff() # save tiffs from last scan
  prun(sa, TrampUp)
  prun(sa, TrampDow)
  prun(sa, tseries)
  save_tiff(db[-3:]) # save tiffs from last three scans
