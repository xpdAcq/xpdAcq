Tiff naming schema:
  The tiff file will be saved with the name:

  .. code-block:: none

    <sample_name>_<scanplan_name>_<time_stamp>_<uid>_<something_else>_<sequence_number>.tif

  All the information in the ``scanplan`` and ``sample`` objects will be saved to metadata and searchable and usable for processing later.
  ``<uid>`` is the unique identifier to this ``scanplan``. You can use it to search specific scan later.
  ``<something-else>`` depends on the ``scanplan`` type, for example, for a ``Tramp`` it is the actual temperature read from the temperature controller
  when the data-collection was initiated for that point.
  ``<sequence number>`` will be in ``0001, 0002, ...`` format, which tells you the sequence index of ``scan`` from a``scanplan``.
