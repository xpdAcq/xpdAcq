Release Note
-------------


``v0.3``
========

This is the first full, stable, release, of xpdAcq software.
It offers functionality to acquire data at XPD but with very limited
tools yet to analyze it.
Future releases will focus more on analysis functionalities.
``v0.3`` is still a limited functionality release in that it only supports three kinds of scans:

.. code-block:: none

  single-frame (ct)
  time-series (tseries)
  temperature-series scans (Tramp)

Additional scan types will be added in future releases.

However, it does support:
 * automated dark subtraction
 * automated calibration capture.

This version is fully documented and extensively tested.
